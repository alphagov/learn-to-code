# Setting up your computer

If you’re using a Mac, most of the software you need for these lessons is already installed.

## Text editor (Visual Studio Code)

Programmers use **text editors** to write code. You could use Notepad (Windows)
or TextEdit (Mac) to write code. However most programmers use a text editor
with programming-specific features:

* **Syntax highlighting** shows your code in different colours. This helps you spot
  any errors, and understand the structure of your code.
* **Auto-indent** helps you keep your code tidy.
* **Project navigation and tabs** helps you move between the different files in
  your project.
* **Auto-completion** shows you keywords you could use to finish what you’re
  typing, so you don’t have to remember all the possible commands.

We recommend you use [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev) for this because it provides a zero-install experience running entirely in your browser.

## Terminal and Ruby

macOs comes with a built in terminal, and a version of the ruby programming
language. If you're not using a mac you can follow the instructions on the ruby website:
