# Lesson 3: Writing Ruby Scripts

## Introduction

### Objectives

In this tutorial we are going to look at:

* getting user input
* doing things multiple times using loops
* building simple programs
* using `require` to access other Ruby modules
* using Ruby's `Date` type
* using `File` to read files in Ruby

### Goal

By the end of this tutorial you will have used what you learnt in lesson 2 to
build a couple of small Ruby programs, including one like [this times tables game](https://repl.it/@RichardTowers/TimesTablesGame).

### Running a file with Ruby

We've been having fun with `irb` in Lesson 2 - it's a great tool for exploring and
learning about Ruby. Ideally though we'd like to be able to save our programs
for later, and run them whenever we want.

To do this, we can write a Ruby script in a text editor (like you did with HTML in
lesson 1), then run the script from the command line with `ruby name-of-your-script.rb`.

Ruby files end with the extension `.rb`.

#### Task 1: My first Ruby script

* Exit `irb` by running the `exit` command
* Create a file in your text editor (we recommended Visual Studio Code in lesson 1) called `hello.rb`
* Confirm you can see the file in the command line by running `ls`
* From the command line, use Ruby to run your file by typing `ruby hello.rb` and pressing enter
* You should see nothing returned (because `hello.rb` is empty at the moment)

### Interacting with the user

Now that we're running our Ruby from a file, we can't rely on `irb` to handle
all of our user input and output. When we want to show something to the user
we need to explicitly say so, and likewise, when we want some input from the
user we have to explicitly ask for it.

Ruby provides a `puts` method (put string) and a `gets` method (get
string).

* `puts` - prints a string to the command line
* `gets` - waits for the user to type one line of text into the command line,
  when they press enter, returns whatever the user typed (so you can store it
  in a variable)

#### Task 2: Hello world!

Add the following to your `hello.rb` file, save it, and run it with `ruby hello.rb`:

```ruby
puts("What is your name?")
name = gets
puts("Hello #{name}")
```

We can use `puts` and `gets` to create a very simple text based user interface.

#### Getting things wrong in Ruby scripts

Just like `irb`, if you get something wrong in a Ruby script Ruby will tell
you by printing an error message. Nothing to worry about - programmers make
mistakes all the time.

Imagine a script called `oops.rb` containing:

```ruby
puts("time for a deliberate error")
oops("this won't work")
```

When you run this with `ruby oops.rb` you'll get an error like this:

```
time for a deliberate error
oops.rb:2:in `<main>': undefined method `oops' for main:Object (NoMethodError)
```

The `oops.rb:2` bit at the start tells us what file the error was in, and
what line (2 in this case) the error was on. There's no method called `oops`
so Ruby doesn't know what to do.

#### Task 3: Create a script that reverses the input

Create a new script called `reverse.rb` in your text editor.

Use `gets` to get a string from the user, use `.reverse` to reverse that string,
and use `puts` to print it. 

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
puts("Enter a string to reverse: ")
input = gets
puts("Your string reversed is: ")
puts(input.reverse)
```

</details>

#### Task 4: Create a script that multiplies two numbers

Create a new script called `multiply.rb` in your text editor.

Note that `gets` gets the user input as a `string`. In Ruby strings and
numbers are *not the same* (`"42"` is not equal to `42`).

When you need to ask the user for a number you must ask them for a string and
then convert it into a number using `.to_i` like so:

```ruby
user_input_as_string = gets
user_input_as_number = user_input_as_string.to_i
```

The `i` in `.to_i` stands for "integer" which is fancy way of saying
"whole number".

Use `gets`, `.to_i` and `puts` to get two strings from the user,
converts them to numbers, multiplies them together and prints the result.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
puts("Enter the first number:")
x_string = gets
x_number = x_string.to_i
puts("Enter the second number:")
y_string = gets
y_number = y_string.to_i
puts("#{x_number} * #{y_number} = #{x_number * y_number}")
```

</details>



### Defining methods

The Ruby authors didn't manage to write every method we'll ever need into
Ruby itself, so sometimes we need to define our own.

This means we can write abstractions that describe what we're doing and we
don't have to repeat ourselves.

Earlier, we had this line of code:

```ruby
age_dog_years = age_human_years * 7
```

This is okay, but it's a little surprising to see that `7` in there - what's
it doing? It would be nicer if we could write:

```ruby
age_dog_years = convert_to_dog_years(age_human_years)
```

and hide away the grubby implementation details inside a method.

In Ruby a method definition looks like this:

```ruby
def method_name(argument)
  result = "some value"
  return result
end
```

You can name a method anything you could name a variable (they're
`snake_cased` by convention too). They can have as many lines of code inside
them as you want.

#### Task 5: Create a script that converts human years to dog years

Create a script called `dog-years.rb`. Use `puts`, `gets` and `.to_i`
to ask the user how old their dog is.

Assuming that dogs age faster than humans, and that there are seven "dog
years" to one "human year", define a method which:

* takes an age in human years as a argument
* multiplies the age in human years by seven
* returns the result of the multiplication

Call the method in your script, and print the result.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
def convert_to_dog_years(age)
  return age * 7
end

puts("How old is your dog in human years?")
age_human_years_string = gets
age_human_years_number = age_human_years_string.to_i

age_dog_years = convert_to_dog_years(age_human_years_number)
puts("Your dog is #{age_dog_years} in dog years")
```

</details>

### Repeating things

<img src="/images/lesson-2/brøther.jpg" alt="Meme where a cat looks at a bowl of fruit loops, and says 'brøether, may i have the lööps'" style="max-width: 300px;">

So far, each line of code we've written has run exactly once (each time a
script runs). Ruby goes through each line in the script, runs it, then moves
on to the next line. When it reaches the end of the file, the script exits.

One of the things that computers are really good at is repeating themselves.
In Ruby we can use methods like `loop` and `.times` to make the computer
repeat things.

You might want to try some of the following out in `irb` to get a feel for
how they work. (If you get stuck in a loop in `irb` you can escape it by
pressing `ctrl + c`):

```ruby
5.times do
  puts("Odelay!")
end
```

```ruby
10.times do |i|
  puts("#{10 - i} green bottles, hanging on the wall,")
  puts("#{10 - i} green bottles, hanging on the wall,")
  puts("And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,")
  puts("There'll be #{9 - i} green bottles hanging on the wall.")
  puts
end
```

```ruby
loop do
  puts("What's your name?")
  name = gets
  puts("Hello #{name} (to exit this infinite loop, press ctrl+c)")
end
```

The bit between the `do` and the `end` is called a block, which is run by the
method repeatedly. Blocks can take parameters after the `do`, which are
wrapped in vertical pipes like `|i|`.

#### Task 6: Update one of your scripts to work in a loop

Earlier, you wrote a few scripts that ask the user for some input, do
something with the input then print the result and exit. Change one of these
scripts (e.g. `multiply.rb`) so they do this in an infinite loop (using `loop`).

If you get stuck in an infinite loop (a loop which never ends)  in the command
line you can break out by pressing `ctrl + c`.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
loop do
  puts("Enter the first number:")
  x_string = gets
  x_number = x_string.to_i
  puts("Enter the second number:")
  y_string = gets
  y_number = y_string.to_i
  puts("#{x_number} * #{y_number} = #{x_number * y_number}")
end
```

</details>

### Conditionals

One last thing to learn is how to get the computer to do something based on
some condition. To do this, we can use the `if` statement, like so:

```ruby
puts("What is your name?")
name = gets
if name.include?("r")
  puts("Hi #{name} - you sound like a pretty cool person")
else
  puts("Hi nerd")
end
```

An `if` statement takes a "condition" (something that evaluates
to `true` or `false`). You can use things like `==` (equals), `<` (less than),
or methods like `.include?` (like we did in the example).

Note that we use `==` instead of `=` to compare two values.  This is because
`==` tests if two values are equal, whereas `=` assigns the value on the right
to the variable on the left.

If the condition is true Ruby will run the lines of code between
the `if` and the `else`, otherwise Ruby will run the lines of code between
the `else` and the `end`.

### Tying it all together

Phew! That was a lot to learn. To recap, we've learned:

* how to use `irb`
* how to use numbers
* what "strings" are and how to use them
* how to use variables to name things
* how to "interpolate" strings
* how to call methods
* how to run Ruby from a file
* how to interact with a user
* how to define methods
* how to repeat things
* how to do things conditionally

If you've understood all of that, well done! You now know the basics of
programming. There's a lot more to learn, but it all builds on these
fundamentals.

To tie everything you've learned together, here's one final "hard" task.

#### Task 7: Build a times tables game

Right at the beginning, we said you'd build [this times tables game](https://repl.it/@RichardTowers/TimesTablesGame).

To do this you'll need to use everything you've just learned. It's a pretty
difficult problem for a beginner, so if you get stuck on something don't be
afraid to ask for help.

Here's a rough plan of how to implement this:

* create a `score` variable to keep track of the users score
* in a loop that happens 4 times
  * generate two numbers between 1 and 12 using `rand` and assign them to variables
  * print a message to the user asking them to multiply the numbers together
  * get the user's answer and covert it to a number (using `.to_i`)
  * compare the user's answer to the answer Ruby thinks is correct
  * show the user a message saying whether they're correct (and add one to their score)
* if the user scored 4 then show them a message saying they got them all right
* otherwise, show the user a message commiserating them for their failure

For bonus points, consider whether you could define a method to do some of
the work to make the loop easier to read.

<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
def multiplication_challenge
  x = rand(12) + 1
  y = rand(12) + 1

  print("What is #{x} multiplied by #{y} ? ")
  user_input = gets
  user_input_as_a_number = user_input.to_i

  correct_answer = x * y
  if user_input_as_a_number == correct_answer
    puts(":) correct!")
    return true
  else
    puts(":( oops!")
    puts("The answer was #{correct_answer}")
    return false
  end
end

number_of_rounds = 4
score = 0

puts("Times tables challenge")
puts("----------------------")
puts
puts("You will be asked #{number_of_rounds} questions.")
puts("Press enter to start...")
gets

number_of_rounds.times do |i|
  if multiplication_challenge
    score = score + 1
  end
end

if score == number_of_rounds
  puts("You scored #{score}/#{number_of_rounds}. Well done!")
else
  puts("You scored #{score}/#{number_of_rounds}. Better luck next time!")
end
```

</details>

### Using `require` to access other Ruby modules

In lesson 2 we used a number of built-in Ruby methods, like `rand` (to get
a random number), `.reverse` (to reverse a string), `gets` and
`puts` (to read and write strings from the command line).

These methods are so useful that they live in the core of Ruby, so you can
always call them.

Some bits of Ruby are used less often, and these are not included by default.
To use these other bits you need to `require` them. For example, the `"date"`
module lets you work with dates and times, but it isn't included by default.

Running `require("date")` includes the date code so you can use it in your
script. For example:

```
irb(main):001:0> require("date")
=> true
irb(main):002:0> Date.today
=> #<Date: 2019-05-30 ((2458633j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

### Working with Dates in Ruby

Ruby's date type makes doing things like adding days to a date much easier
(if you didn't have a date type you'd need to worry about how many days there
are in a month and so on).

```
irb(main):003:0> one_thousand_days_in_the_future = Date.today + 1000
=> #<Date: 2022-02-23 ((2459633j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

The `.today` method gets today's date, but you can also create dates for
other days using `.new`:

```
irb(main):004:0> Date.new(2022, 2, 23)
=> #<Date: 2022-02-23 ((2459633j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

Because different cultures represent dates in different ways (e.g. Japan use
2019-05-30, the USA use 05/30/2019 and the UK use 30/05/2019), there's a
special method for formatting dates as strings called `.strftime`. It takes
a "format" string as an argument specifying how to show the date:

```
irb(main):005:0> japan_format = Date.today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
=> "2019-05-30"
irb(main):006:0> usa_format = Date.today.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
=> "05/30/2019"
irb(main):007:0> uk_format = Date.today.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")
=> "30/05/2019"
```

There are lots of placeholders you can use in your date string, including:

* `%Y` - the year as a 4 digit number
* `%m` - the month as a 2 digit number
* `%d` - the day as a 2 digit number
* `%A` - the day of the week as a word (e.g. Thursday)

#### Task 1: What day were you born on?

Using `irb` and the `Date` type, work out what day of the week you were born on.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```
irb(main):001:0> require("date")
=> true

irb(main):002:0> birthday = Date.new(1988, 1, 20)
=> #<Date: 1988-01-20 ((2447181j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>

irb(main):003:0> birthday.strftime("%A")
=> "Wednesday"
```

</details>

### Using `File` to read files in Ruby

Sometimes it's nice to be able to store things in files, and read these files
using Ruby so we can do something with the contents. Ruby has a `File.read`
method that lets us do this.

`File.read` takes the path to the file as an argument, and returns the
contents of the file as a string.

```
irb(main):004:0> File.read("/Users/your-username/Desktop/lesson-1-html-and-css/index.html")
=> "<!doctype html>\n<html>...
```

We can work with the contents using all the string methods (like
`.reverse`) we've already seen.

There are lots of other useful methods like `.size` (which returns how many
characters there are in the string), and `.sub` (which takes two arguments,
and substitutes the first occurence of the first string with the second).

```
irb(main):005:0> "Cats are the best".sub("Cat", "Dog")
=> "Dogs are the best"
irb(main):006:0> "Dogs are the best".size
=> 17
```

#### Task 2: count the characters in a file

We created a file in `lesson-1-html-and-css/index.html`. Use `File.read`
and `.size` to work out how many characters there are in the file.

> In Finder you can copy the path to a directory by right clicking, holding
down the option key (`⌥`), and choosing *Copy "Directory" as Pathname*.
Alternatively, you can drag the folder onto the terminal and it will type
the path for you.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```
irb(main):006:0> file = File.read("/Users/your-username/Desktop/lesson-1-html-and-css/index.html")
=> "<!doctype html>\n<html>...
irb(main):007:0> file.size
1260
```
